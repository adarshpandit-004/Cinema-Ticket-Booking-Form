## 📖 Overview
This project showcases my foundational skills in **Server-Side Web Development**, implemented using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and server-side validation techniques.  
It includes three core components — each demonstrating my ability to create dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly web applications with a focus on input validation, data persistence, and responsive design.

The assignment is divided into three parts:
1. **Part A:** Cinema Ticket Booking Form  
2. **Part B:** House Appliance Inventory System  
3. **Part C:** Sticky Form with Validation and Error Handling  



## 🎬 Part A – Cinema Ticket Booking Form
A simple yet dynamic web application that allows users to book cinema tickets online.

### 🔧 Features
- User-friendly form to collect mobile number, showtime, and movie selection.
- Server-side validation ensures accurate and complete data submission.  
- Displays a confirmation message upon successful submission.  
- Clean and structured layout designed for intuitive interaction.

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Implementing server-side validation logic.  
- Handling form data and confirmation messages securely.  
- Structuring user inputs to ensure data integrity.



## 🏠 Part B – House Appliance Inventory System
A more advanced section focused on CRUD-style form handling and structured data entry.

### 🔧 Features
- Form to record appliance details such as **Eircode**, **Appliance Type**, **Brand**, **Model**, **Serial Number**, **Purchase Date**, and **Warranty Date**.  
- Validations to ensure that all inputs match expected formats (e.g., Eircode regex pattern).  
- Displays a detailed confirmation page summarizing all entered information.  
- Focused on both functional correctness and visual consistency.

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Advanced form validation using regex and conditional checks.  
- Implementing clean, reusable form components.  
- Managing multiple input types and ensuring proper sanitization.



## 🧾 Part C – Sticky Form with Validation and Error Handling
This part enhances the inventory form with **sticky functionality**, meaning user inputs persist even after validation errors — improving usability and accessibility.

### 🔧 Features
- Retains valid input data when the user submits invalid fields.  
- Displays targeted error messages beside incorrect inputs.  
- Server-side processing to handle, validate, and sanitize data effectively.  
- Ensures successful submissions display a final confirmation message.

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Implementing “sticky form” logic to improve user experience.  
- Handling multiple validation and sanitization layers.  
- Developing robust error handling and re-rendering strategies in Next.js.  
- Understanding how to separate client-side rendering from server-side logic cleanly.



## 🧩 Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Next.js (Server-Side Rendering)  
- **Validation:** Regex and server-side logic  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Localhost environment with modular structure  



## 📄 Visual Overview
**File:** `UI Screen_visual.pdf`  
This PDF contains screenshots of each form’s interface, submission confirmation, and validation behavior, demonstrating the workflow and user experience for all three parts.



## 🚀 What I Learned
- Structuring multi-part web applications using modular approaches.  
- Integrating server-side validation with responsive form interfaces.  
- Managing user input, data validation, and error feedback effectively.  
- Applying professional coding standards, folder structures, and consistent UI design.  
- Using Git for version control and progressive project commits.



## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Store submitted form data in a MySQL database.  
- Add user authentication for restricted form access.  
- Expand appliance form to support file uploads (e.g., receipts).  
- Implement dark/light mode toggle for enhanced accessibility.  



## 🧠 Summary
This project highlights my progression from **basic form handling** to **fully validated, user-friendly server-side web forms**.  
It demonstrates my growing expertise in **Next.js**, **server-side validation**, and **UI/UX consistency**, setting a solid foundation for building larger-scale web applications.
